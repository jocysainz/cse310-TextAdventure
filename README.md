# Overview

As someone who is passionate about gaming, being able to develope my own interactive story game was really fascinating. I created a text based adventure game in C# to deepen my understanging of object oriented programming.

I developed a text game adventure game in C# that shows key points of the language through the story. The game give you the choice to choose either to be a warrior or mage, each one has differnt health attributes and they navigate the story differntly because of it. 

I wanted to challenge myself to learn a new way to create an interactive game that combines storytelling and interactive gameplay. By doing all of that it strengheted my understanding of C# and be a better coder.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used VS code as my IDE. I used the .NET SDK to compile and run the C# code. This setup allowed to efficiently write, test, and debug my code in a lightweight environment. 

For the language I used for the project is C#. No external libraries were used, the goal was to focus on masteting the fundamentals of C#.
